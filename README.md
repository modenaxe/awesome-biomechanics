#### Tools related to Finite Element Analysis :mortar_board:

* **GIBBON Toolbox** by [Kevin Moerman](https://kevinmoerman.org/). GIBBON (The Geometry and Image-Based Bioengineering add-On) is an open-source MATLAB toolbox that includes an array of image and geometry visualization and processing tools and is interfaced with free open source software such as TetGen, for robust tetrahedral meshing, and FEBio and Abaqus for finite element analysis. The combination provides a highly flexible image-based modelling environment and enables advanced inverse finite element analysis.

### Optimal Control and Trajectory Optimization :rocket: [WIP]

* **OpenSim Moco** by Chris Dembia, Nick Bianco and the OpenSim team (2019). OpenSim Moco is a software toolkit to solve optimal control problems with musculoskeletal models defined in OpenSim, including those with kinematic constraints. Using the direct collocation method, Moco can solve a wide range of problems, including motion tracking, motion prediction, and parameter optimization. The design of Moco focuses on ease-of-use, customizability, and extensibility. Just like OpenSim itself, Moco has interfaces in XML/command-line, Matlab, Python, Java, and C++.
